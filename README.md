# graph $p$-modulus in Python

This repo contains a work-in-progress Python module for approximating the $p$-modulus for graphs introduced by Albin, Poggi-Corradini, and their colleagues.

## Dependencies

Our code relies on the following modules:

- `numpy` for ...
- `cvxpy` for ...
- `python-igraph` for constructing and manipulating mathematical graphs

See the file `installation-notes.txt` for more detail.

## Examples

For now, the file `ExampleGraphs.py` contains several examples from the original papers used validate the methods.
